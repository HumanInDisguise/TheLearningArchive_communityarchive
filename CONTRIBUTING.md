 Welcome to the Contributing page for TheLearningArchives.
 Most of the content provided here comes from the creative community of artists, developers, teachers and content creators found all over the world. We want to promote all their educational work at the same time while curating what we can to provide access to students and everyone who needs a centralised location to learn their creative pathway in the game and film industries. 

The support of the community is what is required to bring this global educational system to fruition. Anyone who wants to provide information to help improve the learning paths can use this GitHub repository to give their support.
