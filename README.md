# Introduction
Welcome to TheLearningArchives GitHub page. 

This community-driven archive is a repository for gathering and creating learning materials through support and sources cited by the community. The purpose of this repo is to collect, curate, and collate all the publicly available material into TheLearningArchives learning paths to provide a free platform for student learning.
